This repository contains the code for an E-commerce landing page. The landing page is developed using HTML, CSS and Animation. The repository is organized into three main sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the landing page.

## Section 1: HTML & Web Accessibility

This section contains the HTML code for the landing page, which includes:

- **Header**: This includes a logo and a navigation menu.
- **Hero Section**: This features a catchy headline, a subheading, and a call-to-action button.

- **Customer Reviews/Testimonials**: This helps build trust and credibility.
- **Newsletter Subscription Form**: This captures user email addresses for marketing purposes.
- **Footer**: This includes links to important pages, contact information, and social media icons.

The HTML code is tested for accessibility using automated tools and assistive technologies, and any identified issues are fixed.

## Section 2: CSS Styling

- A sticky header or footer to ensure navigation or important information remains visible while scrolling.
- A responsive layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox for proper alignment and positioning of page elements.
